<content state="APPROVED" last_approved_text="In the Old World of Total War: WARHAMMER, magic is manifested in spellcasters' abilities on the battlefield. Each one has access to a lore of magical spells which have a variety of effects – they can grant simple bonuses and penalties, devastate large areas with explosive bombardments, concentrate powerful damage upon individual combatants, or simply disrupt whole groups of enemies by knocking them clean off their feet.\n\nWhenever you field a magic-user in battle, the Winds of Magic panel appears in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen to indicate that spellcasting is possible. Selecting your spellcaster reveals their repertoire of spells as buttons around the circular panel; mousing over each spell button reveals important details. Each spell has a power cost – in order to cast it, you must have enough current power, as indicated by the number within the panel’s Power Orb. Any spell with a power cost exceeding your current power level will be greyed-out with a large red ‘X’ on its icon, indicating that it cannot be activated at present. Although your power level depletes with every spell cast, it also replenishes over time according to its recharge rate, which enables the repeated casting spells at suitable intervals. Directly to the right of the Power Orb is the Power Reserve bar, which indicates the total power that could still be drawn from the Winds before the battle ends. It also depletes every time you cast a spell, but unlike your current power, your reserve will never recharge – once it is exhausted, you will not be able to cast further spells during that battle.

However, they do create powerful potions and runes to augment their warriors and weapons, giving them abilities that can have many of the same effects as spells." last_edit_user="bob">In the Old World of Total War: WARHAMMER, magic is manifested in spellcasters' abilities on the battlefield. Each one has access to a lore of magical spells which have a variety of effects – they can grant simple bonuses and penalties, devastate large areas with explosive bombardments, concentrate powerful damage upon individual combatants, or simply disrupt whole groups of enemies by knocking them clean off their feet.\n\nWhenever you field a magic-user in battle, the Winds of Magic panel appears in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen to indicate that spellcasting is possible. Selecting your spellcaster reveals their repertoire of spells as buttons around the circular panel; mousing over each spell button reveals important details. Each spell has a power cost – in order to cast it, you must have enough current power, as indicated by the number within the panel’s Power Orb. Any spell with a power cost exceeding your current power level will be greyed-out with a large red ‘X’ on its icon, indicating that it cannot be activated at present. Although your power level depletes with every spell cast, it also replenishes over time according to its recharge rate, which enables the repeated casting spells at suitable intervals. Directly to the right of the Power Orb is the Power Reserve bar, which indicates the total power that could still be drawn from the Winds before the battle ends. It also depletes every time you cast a spell, but unlike your current power, your reserve will never recharge – once it is exhausted, you will not be able to cast further spells during that battle. Additionally, once your reserves are used up, the power recharge rate will slow.

Siege battles occur whenever a major settlement or an upgraded minor settlement is attacked. Once an army initiates the attack, the Pre-Battle panel will be displayed, prompting you to choose to fight the battle on the 3D battlefield, automatically resolve it, or withdraw. When attacking settlements, it is also possible to encircle it or continue besieging, giving you the chance to starve the defenders out without shedding blood.

Sieges are different from standard land battles because they do not have to be resolved immediately. Depending on its size, a settlement can endure a number of turns under siege before it falls to its attackers. However, as long as a besieging force does not initiate an assault (either by choice, or due to the absence of siege engines against a walled settlement) and the defenders do not sally out to attack it in the field, a siege can be prolonged until the bitter end. Sallying-out whilst under siege and being defeated does not cede your settlement to the besiegers.

When under siege, there are three considerations – the number of turns before the defenders' supplies run out or until they are starved into defeat, and the presence of walled fortifications. Whilst they still have supplies, garrison troops will not suffer attrition from disease and starvation; when they run out, their numbers will slowly start to deplete. Due to their large stocks and access to supplies, port settlements survive longer in this respect.

<content state="APPROVED" last_approved_text="Every unit has a specific type which dictates its use in battle and style of combat. Displayed on the bottom of the unit card, it is indicated by a small icon, such as an axe, a crossbow, a pistol etc. to indicate whether its troops are cavalry, infantry, artillery or beasts. Infantry make up the bulk of your forces; tightly-packed groups of soldiers, fighting either hand-to-hand with melee weapons, or firing from a distance with missile weapons such as crossbows and guns. Cavalry units fight from atop their mounts - be they horses, boars or other beasts; they are swift and powerful on the charge, but generally less numerous and vulnerable in sustained combat. Cavalry units can be missile troops as well, able to harass enemies from a distance. Artillery are primarily siege weapons, useful for sending extremely powerful ordnance hurtling into both enemy formations, where they cause massive damage, or at the walls of settlements, weakening them prior to a siege assault.

Displayed on the bottom of the unit card, it is indicated by a small icon, such as an axe, a crossbow, a pistol etc. to indicate whether its troops are cavalry, infantry, artillery or beasts. Infantry make up the bulk of your forces; tightly-packed groups of soldiers, fighting either hand-to-hand with melee weapons, or firing from a distance with missile weapons such as crossbows and guns. Cavalry units fight from atop their mounts - be they horses, boars or other beasts; they are swift and powerful on the charge, but generally less numerous and vulnerable in sustained combat. Cavalry units can be missile troops as well, able to harass enemies from a distance. Artillery are primarily siege weapons, useful for sending extremely powerful ordnance hurtling into both enemy formations, where they cause massive damage, or at the walls of settlements, weakening them prior to a siege assault.

Amber can be spent on improving the Oak of Ages, which the Wood Elves must nurture in order to achieve victory.\n-          Wood Elf factions may use the Worldroots to move beneath otherwise-impassable terrain.\n-          A variety of benefits may be gained by appointing Lords of the Wood Elves to either the Elven Council or the Gathering of the Ancients.\n\nSee below for further details:</content>

The more wars they are involved in, the less likely they are to declare war on you.\n\n-          Use your most rapid units to harass enemy missile units and light, mounted units before your main force reaches their battle lines. This will tie them up, and keep the pressure off your melee troops and is a suitable tactic for swift Vampire units, such as Dire Wolves or Fell Bats, or if playing as Chaos, Chaos Warhounds.\n\n-          Mounted troops are effective on the charge, but vulnerable if caught in sustained melee. Try to trap enemy cavalry units while stopping the enemy from doing the same to yours.\n\n-          Many monsters and beasts are anti-infantry units that can cause enemies to rout in terror, but be aware that some infantry types specialise in taking down large units (e.g. the Empire’s Halberdiers and Dwarfs’ Slayers).\n\n-          Using artillery can be devastating but remember it can be highly vulnerable to faster, mounted units. If you discover too late that you’ve left them vulnerable to a flanking manoeuvre or sneak attack, use first person mode (by pressing the Insert key) to make a last stand. Fire your artillery directly into the charging enemy as a last resort!\n\n-          Troops fleeing from battle may recover their wits and return to the fray, given enough time. Attempt to end the battle before they do, or send some of your faster units to harass them until they leave the battlefield altogether.\n\n-          In a pitched battle, always keep check that your units are still able to fight effectively. You can see what each unit is doing at a glance by checking the icons above their portraits. As long you keep your melee units in melee and your missile units shooting, your army will perform well even during the most chaotic of battles.\n\n-          When up against artillery bombardment, try using the terrain (such as forests, hills, or valleys) to stay unseen for as long as possible, so that the enemy are unable to target you and you are able to avoid as much damage as possible. This also opens up opportunities to surprise your enemies with battlefield ambushes.\n\nMake sure to keep your Lords and Heroes close to your main force; they don’t only provide increased leadership for nearby allied units, but can also use their unique combinations of spells, abilities, attributes and mounts to turn the tide of battle.\n\n-          Effective preparation against flanking manoeuvres can mean the difference between winning or losing a battle. Place units with better charge defence – such as those with elongated weapons such as spears or halberds - either side of your army to protect its flanks. At the same time, also be aware of head-on cavalry charges to the centre of your battle line.\n\n-          When defending a siege, it’s advisable to hold some troops in reserve and off the walls if possible. This way, if the enemy break through your gates or walls, you can plug the gap or fall back to hold a choke point in the city. Strong, tough units such as Black Orcs or Grave Guards are especially useful here, as they can hold the line whilst you consolidate the rest of your forces.\n\n-          Always  ensure that your missile infantry are actually able to fire on the enemy. Crossbow users can fire arcing shots from the back of a formation, but those armed with muskets must have a direct line of sight to their targets. Observe the lay of the land and try to position them effectively, without exposure to enemy melee units.\n\n-          Missile cavalry can tear enemy units to shreds but are extremely vulnerable and will die rapidly if forced to exchange fire with enemy archers. Tie up the enemy in melee with infantry, then bring your missile cavalry around to their rear and shoot the foe from behind.\n\n-          There are regular and upgraded variants of spells. When casting an upgraded spell, there is a chance that the Wizard will miscast, causing himself a significant amount of indefensible damage. The spell will still be successfully cast, but you may find your Wizard much closer to death than before!\n\n-          The Unit Details panel (which can be toggled by pressing the I key) provides live feedback based on what is happening to your troops and characters. At the bottom of the panel there is a list of attribute, spell, and ability icons for each unit, separated by a line underneath each one.

Schwartzhafen is better off annexed than allied with, but Templehof should be dealt with first.\n\n-          The Empire and the Dwarfs will probably leave you alone, for the most part. Try not to antagonise anyone with a large web of alliances. Fight wars on your own terms.\n\n-          Expanding west and south is safer than north. As tempting as Ostermark and Kislev may be, they serve as strong buffer states.\n\n-          Dwarf settlements can be sacked to significantly bolster your economy. There are very few chokepoints between the Dwarf Clans and Sylvania, so it should not be too difficult to maintain a standing defence against them. Dwarfs in the Black Mountains and Grey Mountains are better off dead.\n\n-         Don't underestimate Zombies!

Courting Dwarf neighbours early on will be easier than in the mid or late games.\n\n-          Make up for the Vampire Counts’ lack of missile troops by sending expendable units such as Fell Bats or Dire Wolves forth to swarm over enemies, keeping them occupied whilst you close the distance with more powerful melee troops. By the same virtue, taking a few units of Fell Bats to siege battles can be the difference between winning and losing – your expendable Fell Bat swarms can be positioned in front of siege towers to soak up missile fire from defending archers and wall towers, allowing the main force to reach the walls without suffering excessive damage.\n\n-          Vampire Counts characters being harassed by missile troops or artillery can potentially cast Raise Dead right underneath their attackers’ feet, quickly forcing them into an uncomfortable melee combat situation against zombies and skeletons!" last_edit_user="bob">-          Consolidate Sylvania before turning your eyes to the other races. Schwartzhafen is better off annexed than allied with, but Templehof should be dealt with first.\n\n-          The Empire and the Dwarfs will probably leave you alone, for the most part. Try not to antagonise anyone with a large web of alliances. Fight wars on your own terms.\n\n-          Expanding west and south is safer than north. As tempting as Ostermark and Kislev may be, they serve as strong buffer states.\n\n-          Dwarf settlements can be sacked to significantly bolster your economy. There are very few chokepoints between the Dwarf Clans and Sylvania, so it should not be too difficult to maintain a standing defence against them.

<content state="APPROVED" last_approved_text="The Underway is a vast, sprawling network of tunnels and highways beneath the surface of the Old World, constructed by the Dwarfs during their golden age of empire. At one time, it spanned the length and breadth of the Old World, enabling the Dwarfs to pass beneath the mountains and lakes without as much as a worry. Yet the Underway was also the instrument of the Dwarfs' undoing; the Greenskins, upon discovering it, harnessed the tactical advantage of the tunnels to launch systematic, devastating attacks on the Dwarfholds. The resulting wars devastated the underground network and trapped the Dwarfs in isolated, fractured mountain redoubts. \n\nThese days, the Underway is a broken, shattered shadow of its former glory, and yet still has the potential to connect distant lands with ease, to those who know how to use it. The tunnels are fraught with danger and peril, yet the wise Dwarf and Greenskin commander can still navigate the highways, broken though they may be, to travel underneath threats which would otherwise be their undoing. However, in its current state, the Underway is not completely undetectable and those who use it will likely be intercepted.
