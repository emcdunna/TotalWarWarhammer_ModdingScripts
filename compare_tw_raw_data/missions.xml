Let the carnage begin under Khazrak’s command, so it is his name called as the blood starts to flow." last_edit_user="bob">The curses of man are many - they think to purge the forests of the warherds! Todbringer sends out his armies from Middenheim to rid the Drakwald of Gors. They have slain bray-kin, while the chieftains vie for petty power. However, should the Cloven Ones flock to one banner, Middenheim stands high on the Ulricsberg plateau, making a brute force attack futile. No, to make Boris Todbringer pay, a more cunning approach is needed if the Children of Chaos are to raze his city to ash and ruin… \n\nKhazrak knows that the Elector Count of Middenheim is an honourable fool. Once he sees his people burning, Boris will surely come to their rescue, luring him away from the Ulricsberg. Such acts will also cause panic and fear in the Empire’s subjects, and quicken Beastmen hearts. Let the carnage begin under Khazrak’s command, so it is his name called as the blood starts to flow.</localised_description>

For starters, Skarsnik will send his regards to the homelands of those who seek to steal from his domain!" last_edit_user="bob">It is said that there is a whole chapter in the Dammaz Kron on Skarsnik, the self-proclaimed Warlord of the Eight Peaks. Both the Dwarfs and the Skaven despise him, and yet none doubt his supremacy over the region. The fact he has achieved such an iron grip, although merely a Night Goblin and not some brutal Orc, says more about his malign intelligence than any chapter in some stunties' silly book!\n\nThe Angrund Clan is no more. However, that doesn’t mean Skarsnik can sit safely on his throne of rat skulls. Many covet the lost valuables buried deep in the ancient Dwarf citadel. However, nothing escapes the eyes and ears of the Warlord. News of an enemy treasure-seeking expedition quickly reaches him and a wicked plan begins to form within the chief gobbo’s mind.

He fell in battle against a Greenskin horde, sacrificing himself to save the man who would unite the tribes of men into the Empire. Such greatness of spirit is a noble thing for most men, but to Kemmler it represents only a potential source of power waiting to be tapped.

According to her dark magicians only one stage remains: she must defile the resting place of a great and mighty soul. She knows of no greater soul than Marbad, First of the Elector Counts, and interred nearby. Soon, Isabella muses, she will sup on the blood of the Chaos Gods themselves!
