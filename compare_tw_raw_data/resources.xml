All manner of fairly repulsive substances were used to tan leather, from tannins in tree bark to faeces and animal brains. Tanning was a smelly, dirty and even lethally poisonous trade, and it was usually banished to the outskirts of towns. The leather produced was extremely useful, and this compensated for the foul process.

The technique of blowing glass was discovered in the 1st Century BC and, after the Roman conquest of Egypt in 27BC, glass-making techniques spread throughout the Roman world.

Moulds were rarely used in the ancient world to create the weapons. Instead smiths laboriously smelted the ore at high temperature, breaking the iron free from the slag before shaping it during a hard process of firing and hammering. Iron was used for spear and arrow heads, swords and armour. A well-made iron weapon, however, would cut through bronze. " last_edit_user="bob">placeholder</long_description>

The Romans were great users of lead, with some estimates going as high as 80,000 tonnes per year. Lead was extracted from galena ore that was a by-product of mining for silver. The Romans used this lead, or plumbum, to line baths and make their water pipes, and this use for water pipes gave English the word &quot;plumber&quot;, literally a worker in lead. The Romans and Greeks also produced lead coins and used it in construction. Some boxing gladiators used lead as knuckle covers. The Egyptians used lead to glaze pottery while the Babylonians and Assyrians used lead sheets in buildings. However, lead is a rather toxic material, and some even believe lead pollution contributed to the downfall of the Roman Empire.

Granite, marble and limestone were quarried and used for construction and decorative art by all the classical cultures of Greece, Egypt, Persia, Rome and beyond.

The granite King’s Chamber inside the Great Pyramid of Cheops, the only Wonder to have survived to the present day, is still virtually airtight nearly five thousand years after it was constructed. The Egyptians used limestone for the cladding on the outside of the pyramids because of its beauty. Limestone was a sensible choice given the dry Egyptian climate, but elsewhere rain and time have done terrible damage to limestone buildings and carvings. The Greeks and Romans preferred to use marble for their ornamental buildings and statues, at least as far as decoration was concerned.

The growing and fermenting of grapes began as early 7000BC in what is now the Caucasus. Wine was transported across the Ancient world in the very-recognisable amphorae. To the ancient peoples it was not so much a pleasant drink or a pastime but more a religion. Wine deities are found in every pantheon: Shezmu in Egypt, Bachus in Rome and Dionysus in Greece all looked after the products of fermented grapes. It played an important role in the ceremonial lives of the Egyptians and Greeks. Wherever the Romans conquered they also traded, settled and drank wine. This accounts for the spread of viticulture throughout the Empire years. The major wine regions and grape varieties of France, Italy and Spain we know today can all be traced back to the Romans' love of wine.
