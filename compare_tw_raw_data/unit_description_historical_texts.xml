Assailed by such visions since birth, Cygors are all quite mad. The sheer size and ferocity of a Cygor is terrifying enough to mortals, but those who know of their terrible hunger fear them above all else. To the mage, a Cygor is utterly fearsome, for he knows that of all the warriors on the field of battle it is him alone the Cygor wishes to catch in its gnarled and calloused hands, his flesh it wants to tear apart, and his soul it must devour to slake its unending thirst.</text>

While Gors may have long and spectacular horns as deadly as any sword, Ungors usually have short prongs or horn buds sprouting from their skulls, not recognisable as those of a goat or any other type of beast acknowledged by the Gors. Due to this, they are not considered to be 'proper' Beastmen. The race of men, on the other hand, does not draw such distinctions.

For their part, Night Goblins turn to mushroom-addled ball and chain-wielding Fanatics, Cave Squigs or Troll mobs. For the Dwarfs' defence, the cost in lives is high. It was the Engineers' Guild that invented the drakegun, a weapon which fires a blast of alchemical fury - a searing bolt of blazing energy. Short-ranged but incredibly potent, a single volley from a unit bearing drakeguns can halt the onrushing charge of enraged Mangler Squigs. Ironbreakers who show an aptitude with the drakegun were further trained and formed into new units. When first used, even the Gromril armour of the Ironbreakers struggled to protect against the intense heat generated by the fiery blasts. With the aid of Runesmiths, new armoured suits were developed bearing runes of protection first designed to safeguard those who work in the high temperatures of the massive forges. Now, when confronted by a foe capable of breaking through a wall of Ironbreakers, a new fighting tactic has been developed. Ironbreakers open ranks to allow the Irondrakes to file past. With well-drilled precision and the barking orders of an Ironwarden, the dark is soon illuminated by molten blasts. The stalwart Dwarfs blaze away as attackers fall, their crumpled bodies still smoking with fist-sized holes burned through their flesh. The Irondrakes have proven so effective that their services are pressed into action wherever a throng may fight.</text>

Known as &quot;Da Great Green Prophet&quot;, he is guided along his path by the Greenskin gods. He leads tribes to greatness before wandering off to pursue yet another mad plan to advance Orc-kind. Wurrzag's green crusade began in the Southlands when, with the magical energy that arched uncontrollably out of his eyes, he transformed the former Shaman of the Bone Nose tribe into a Squiggly Beast. As the tribe prepared to ritually eat Wurrzag for this deed, the marinated Orc entered a trance and spouted a tale of long ago, when the now-sorry Bone Nose tribe ruled the lands. The cold-blooded ones came and built great pyramids, driving the tribe away and destroying their idols. Since those shameful days, the tribe has lived under a curse. Wurrzag rekindled their spirit of conquest and, filling in for their transformed Shaman, led the Bone Nose warriors to level the nearest Lizardmen-city. Using the rubble of the wrecked pyramid, Wurrzag ordered the Greenskins to erect two edifices.

Known as &quot;Da Great Green Prophet&quot;, he is guided along his path by the Greenskin gods. He leads tribes to greatness before wandering off to pursue yet another mad plan to advance Orc-kind. Wurrzag's green crusade began in the Southlands when, with the magical energy that arched uncontrollably out of his eyes, he transformed the former Shaman of the Bone Nose tribe into a Squiggly Beast. As the tribe prepared to ritually eat Wurrzag for this deed, the marinated Orc entered a trance and spouted a tale of long ago, when the now-sorry Bone Nose tribe ruled the lands. The cold-blooded ones came and built great pyramids, driving the tribe away and destroying their idols. Since those shameful days, the tribe has lived under a curse.

Morbidly questing after the secrets of death, a Necromancer deeply steeped in the lore of the dead stands on the threshold between worlds, neither wholly alive, nor one of the Undead. His body twisted with unholy power, his mind seared by the horrors he has witnessed, a Necromancer often has more in common with his lurching, moaning minions than with the living he seeks to slay.</text>
